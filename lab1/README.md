### Todos
* Hook up buttons to methods
* Update max temp, min temp, phone # from entry boxes
* Send LED shutdown signal to Arduino
    * This requries code in both python & Arduino code
* Finsh integrating SMS service
    * Setting up environment vars


### Current Issues

* Plot cannot be resized
* When the sensor is unplugged the graph stops real-time plotting. Plugging the sensor back in resumes it and correctly shows a gap in data
* Formatting
